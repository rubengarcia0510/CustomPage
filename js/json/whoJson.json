In order to keep our content fresh and clean, we have to spend some money. We see this as an opportunity for all sorts of sponsors to get in on the conversation. Sure, you might have to hear a 30 second blip here or there, but keep in mind this keeps the content growing! Thank you for your ongoing support!",
